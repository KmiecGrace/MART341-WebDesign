I never coded before in my life. So everything thus far has been very interesting and scary. But more specifically, the most interesting part of learn HTML is how easy it. I was so pleasently surpised on how easy and straight foward everything have been thus far. It have made me feel better about being a complete noivce coming into this class. Something I found difficult is having to remember every little thing. Like everything thing that goes between <>. Like there is so many, from <head> to <body> to div> to <nav>. While what the purpose of them was easy to understand, the remembering of the abbreviation was not. But I had a lot of fun doing this. Being able to explore the inner working of a website is very enjoyable. 
Something I am nervous about moving foward into CSS is how different it might be from HTML. As I mentioned, I found HTML relatively easy and straight-forward, I am unsure it CSS is going to be the same for me or not. It takes me a long time to get the knack of something, so being able to understand HTML as quickly as I did was nice. I am nervous the CSS will not be the same for me.
