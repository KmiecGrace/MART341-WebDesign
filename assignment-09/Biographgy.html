                    Rachilde was the pen name and preffered name of Marguerite Vallette-Eymery (11 February 1860 – 4 April 1953). She was a novelist and playwright born near the city of Périgueux, France. She was born with one leg being shorter than the other, giving her a life long limp. She was unloved and not wanted by her parents. The family's pet monkey recieved more loved than she did, such as the monkey being allowed a seat at the dinner table while she was not.

                <p>
                     She was married to man but her life was not typical of that of a wife. She wore mens clothes, smoke, drank, and cussed like a man. She would discribe herself as androgynous, she neither man or woman.

                <p>
                     One of her idols was Victor Hugo, and his inspratation can be seen in her work. Spreaking of which, her work was noted for being frank, fantastical, and always with a them on questioning the world's stance ongender, sexuality, and identity.
