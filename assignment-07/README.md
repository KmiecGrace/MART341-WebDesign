Some types of formss that I come across while surfing the web are
    1- Text entry
        Such on moodle. It serves to allow someone to input info to a website, this can include entrys for phone numbers or emails or anytype of Info a website would like to collect from you 
    2- File uploads
        This is pretty self explanatory but it to upload files to website. 
    3- Password input
        This is a specific text entry because it is hidden text to protect someone from stealing your password.
    4- Buttons
        Really just used for submitting any text or info that you put in, to the website. 
    5- Drop down boxes
        This is a box that drops down to reveal multiply choices.
