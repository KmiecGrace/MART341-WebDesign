            Rachilde was the pen name and preffered name of Marguerite Vallette-Eymery (11 February 1860 – 4 April 1953). She was a novelist and playwright born near the city of Périgueux, France. Her work was noted for being frank, fantastical, and always with a suggestion of autobiography underlying questions of gender, sexuality, and identity.
