            Summary
        </h3>
       <p>
        <i>Monsieur Venus</i> tells the story of French noblewoman Raoule de Vénérande and her pursuit of sexual pleasure while creating a new and more satisfying identity for herself. In order to escape the mundane and snobbery of her tradition-bound upper class life, she must subvert and transcend social class, gender roles, and sexual morality.
       </p>
       <p> 
        <i> Monsieur Venus</i> is not just a historical porno but instead a commentary on gender and societal roles in 18th century France but the same commentary can be applied to today. It is a rather dark book with the ending being quite a surpise.
