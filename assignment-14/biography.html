           <p>
          Rachilde was the pen name and preferred name of Marguerite Vallette-Eymery. <br> She was born on February 11, 1860 to Joseph and Gabrielle Eymery. <br> Born with one leg shorter than the other, causing her to limp for the rest of her life, it started the tend of her being set apart from others. Marguerite was an unwanted only child, more affection was given to the family's pet monkey. Her childhood was a stuggle for anyone, let alone a child. Both of her parents wer abusive, in their own right. Her mother was an emtional tormentor while her father was a physically abusive. Marguerite, learned from a young age that the world is unfair. <br> The world was not all doom and gloom for Marguerite.<br> The ray of light for her, was her grandmother and grandfather. They foster her imagination through play and reading. They offered her a fantasical esacape from the world. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a young woman, Marguerite wrote anonymously for the local newspaper. She would then have her father read her pieces to her. <br> At 15, she began writing commissions and used the penn name Rachilde for the very first time. During this time, Marguerite began to go against the social norms of High Class societies. She cut her hair short and dress more masculine.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the late 1870s and early 1880s, Marguerite moved to Paris. Here she shed the name "Marguerite" and began using Rachilde in her personal life. <br> With inspiration from Victor Hugo, Rachilde published her first successful novel <em>Monsieur Venus</em>. This book was so scandalous for the pornographic nature, that she was put on trial in Belguim, in absentia, and was sentenced to 2 years in prison. <br> This sentencing cemented her to stay in France for the rest of her life, as French authorities protected her from said judgement. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1889, she married Alfred Vallette. Vallette did not approve of her writing but loved her nevertheless. <br> After the marriage, Rachilde began to subdue her personality and the presentation of herself. She began to dress more feminine for the first time in quite of few years. <br> This how did not affect her writings.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Saturday, April 4, 1953 Rachilde died at the age of 93.

              Rachilde's life was not the average life of a high class parisian woman. She lived openly, freely, and against social norms. She gambled and drank. She wrote, what would be considered, pornographic material.<br> She was not like other girls during this period. In fact she made that fact known, she distrusted women and called them inferior to men. <br> That being said, she developed many deep relationships with women. Some historians, infer she may have had some sexual relationships with ladies, even though she was married to a man.
