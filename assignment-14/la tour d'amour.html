          <p>
            Jean Maleux, a young, naïve sailor who is appointed assistant
            keeper of the Ar-Men lighthouse. He is sent there to help old Mathurin Barnabas, the current
            keeper. <br>Jean makes the crossing to the Ar-Men in stormy weather, and soon begins to find life
            there strange and troubling: Barnabas barely speaks, has forgotten how to read, never washes, and
            moves around the lighthouse in a crab-like crawl. <br>Before long, a ship is wrecked nearby, and the
            bodies of the drowned begin to float by. Jean is horrified by Barnabas indifference, and amazed
            when the old man sets off in a rowing boat despite the continuing storm. The next morning, Jean
            glimpses something unusual in the water. <br>The pale form turns out to be the body of a naked
            woman: Barnabas was not searching for survivors in his boat, but beautiful corpses, and he has
            fastened one there so that the sea can never take her away.
            </p>
            <p>
            La Tour d’amour tells a story of loneliness, guilt, and sexual obsession set in the perilous
            world of a lighthouse off the Brittany coast, creating a gripping psychological drama.
