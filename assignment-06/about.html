    <h1>
        Grace loves recipes that imply <em>suffering</em>. Eggs in Purgatory is an example of this, as it implys the souls of the eggs are sinners that live in purgatory and must repent. What sins have eggs ever committed? Grace does not know but she find it very funny that they do and feel that they need to repent.
